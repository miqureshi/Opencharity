## Approach
- Sementic HTML5
The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document, you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page and its content is.

-- SASS
A preprocessor allows additional leverage over CSS by providing additional syntax that delivers the following advantages:
  - Nested syntax
  - Ability to define variables
  - Ability to define mixin

-- CSS (BEM)
There are plenty of methodologies out there aiming to reduce the CSS footprint, organize cooperation among programmers and maintain large CSS codebases

-- Media Queries
  To target different devices to adjust layout accordingly
